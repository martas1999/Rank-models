In order to reproduce the results of the second simulation (a hundred iterations for each simulated condition) , 
                                                            focused on the Kendall distance metric: 

1)  open the  script “1.simulate_data_hundred_it.R”  to simulate the finishing positions of competitors in different 
games, varying the number of games, the number of entrants, the number of potential competitors and the competitiveness 
levels. The simulated dataset can be found in “sim_df” folder while the corresponding vector of true abilities used to
simulate the game results can be found in “sim_abilities” folder. In the same script the four models are applied to each 
generated dataset and the estimated models can be found in “sim_output” folder. 

N.B. The files "sim_df", "sim_abilities" and "sim_output" are not attached here due to memory constraints.

N.B.: each name files is created by combining together the factors level used to generate the specific dataset.
For example, file name “50_15_2_0.1_1_df” represents the dataset generated from scenario with 50 games, 15 total competitors,
2 entrants, sigma = 0.1 (meaning high competitiveness) and 1st iteration. “50_15_2_0.1_1_ab” is the corresponding vector 
of true abilities of competitors and “50_15_2_0.1_1_beta0/beta1/beta2/rol” indicates the corresponding estimated model.

2) open the script “2.results_elaboration_hundred_it.R” to retrieve for each condition from the estimated models, 
the vector of estimated abilities from each model and the corresponding rankings of competitors. 
These are used to compute the normalised Kendall distances. The grid where the Kendall distances are stored can be
found in the object called “grid_kendall_def.rds”, present in this folder.

3) open the script “3.graphs_hundred_it.R” to reproduce Figure 4, which compares the  normalised Kendall distances 
of the different models by different competitiveness levels and number of entrants;   and reproduce  Figure 5, 
which compares the  normalised Kendall distances of the different models by different competitiveness levels and 
number of games.
