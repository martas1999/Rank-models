In order to reproduce the results of the analysis of Formula 2 races: 

1)  open the  script “1.prep_data_f2.R”  to retrieve the data about the finishing positions of Formula 2 races from the webpage https://fiaresultsandstatistics.motorsportstats.com/results. 
Race results are tidied up by removing the drivers who could not finish the race for any kind of reasons and the proportion of outperformed competitors is computed. 
The data frame containing all the tidy results from seasons 2017-2023 can be found in the f2_data folder under the name “f2_data_tot.rds”

2) open the script “2.models_run_f2.R” to apply each model to the Formula 2 datasets and retrieve the ability estimates  for those drivers who compete at least 30 times.  
Estimated models can be found in “f2_sampling” folder.

3) open the script “3.graphs_f2.R” to produce Figure 6, which compares estimated abilities for the different models, and Table 3, which compared the estimated rankings of 
competitors by the different models.
